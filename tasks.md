# Business CMS - Development Tasks

## Design System

**Color Palette:**

- **Construction Red** `#C62828` - Use sparingly: buttons, hover states, key headings, brand iconography
- **Concrete Grey** `#E0E0E0` or `#F2F2F2` - Background surfaces
- **Charcoal/Graphite** `#212121` or `#2C2C2C` - Primary text
- **White** `#FFFFFF` - Clean negative space

**Usage Guidelines:**

- Backgrounds: light greys and white (air, clarity)
- Text: charcoal (easy to read, clean)
- UI elements: subtle steel greys for dividers, borders
- Highlights/buttons/links: red
- Hover/states: red + muted grey-blue
